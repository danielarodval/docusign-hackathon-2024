# **Rental Agreement Chat Agent**
## **Overview**
The Rental Agreement Chat Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to assist users in understanding rental agreements and calculating end costs. This project integrates with DocuSign’s APIs to provide seamless access to agreement data while offering an intuitive interface for user interaction. Developed as part of the DocuSign Hackathon, the solution leverages AI and DocuSign's ecosystem to enhance user experience and agreement management.

---

## **Objective**
To build an intelligent and user-friendly chat agent that:

- Extracts and explains critical details from rental agreements.
- Calculates and presents end costs dynamically based on user inputs.
- Embeds directly into DocuSign workflows for a seamless experience.
---

## **Technical Approach**
1. **User Interface**:
    - **Custom UI**:
        - Built using modern frameworks like Flask/Django (Python) or React (JavaScript).
        - Allows for interactive chat functionality alongside agreement management.
    - **DocuSign Integration**:
        - Optional embedding into DocuSign workflows via Extension Apps.
        - Offers a native experience for DocuSign users.
2. **Backend**:
    - Powered by Python to connect the custom-built AI chat agent with DocuSign APIs.
    - Integration with DocuSign’s **Navigator API** for extracting agreement data.
3. **Deployment**:
    - **Development**: Local or cloud-hosted for rapid iteration.
    - **Integration Testing**: Utilizes DocuSign’s sandbox environment.
    - **Production**: Optionally deployable as a DocuSign Extension App.
---

## **Key Features**
- **AI-Powered Assistance**:
    - Provides insights into agreement clauses, timelines, and costs.
- **DocuSign API Integration**:
    - Leverages Navigator API for agreement data extraction.
    - Embeds workflows using Extension Apps for streamlined user experiences.
- **Scalable Deployment**:
    - Local development infrastructure for rapid testing.
    - Cloud-hosted solutions or integration within DocuSign's platform for production.
---

## **Development Plan**
1. **Setup**:
    - Register for a DocuSign Developer account.
    - Configure local development environment with Python SDKs and required APIs.
2. **Prototype**:
    - Train the AI model for rental agreement comprehension.
    - Build the backend logic to connect the chat agent with DocuSign’s APIs.
3. **UI Design**:
    - Develop a custom frontend for user interactions.
    - Explore embedding the solution into DocuSign workflows using Extension Apps.
4. **Testing**:
    - Use DocuSign’s sandbox to simulate agreement interactions and validate features.
5. **Deployment**:
    - Host the chat agent on cloud infrastructure or publish it as a DocuSign Extension App.
---

## **Potential Impact**
- Simplifies rental agreement navigation for users.
- Enhances DocuSign’s agreement ecosystem with AI-powered insights.
- Provides a scalable framework for extending AI solutions into other agreement types.
